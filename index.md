`Reservation`: Reservations are how you are able to check out a boat at RBC. Once you have made a reservation, you can then check-in and check-out along with recording mileage and adding incident reports

`Session`: Sessions are how teams are able to create "practices" track regattas and other events. Each session can have lineups, and shells attached which will automatically create a reservation hold for those shells.
